\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
  Soundness, migratory typing.
  Novel run-time check strategy, combines concrete and transient for ergonomics.
\end{abstract}


\section{Typing for Performance}
\label{s:intro}

Go go gradual~\cite{tf-dls-2006,st-sfp-2006}.


\paragraph*{Contributions}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Evidence that gradual soundness works. Performance rises incrementally from runtime engineering and programmer buy-in.
\item
  Informal description of the programming methods that enabled good performance.
  % migration strategy, use of dyn., use of handwritten annotations
\item Formal description of the core language, to promote a reproduction.
\end{itemize}

The language design is a novel point in the space, combining concrete and transient checking strategies.
Concrete has the best performance, but imposes an annotation burden.
Transient mitigates the burden.




\section{A Tour of Static Python}
\label{s:tour}
%% purpose = SP looks like Pyre, adds soundness to certain types


\subsection{Language Pipeline}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Pyre as a recommended, optional pre-check
  \item SP type checker
  \item custom bytecode
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Type Dynamic}

The dynamic type is an important part of Static Python.
Dynamic avoids the need for whole-sale migration,
lets programmers work around dynamic features like splatting,
and is (proof?) in some cases necessary for optimal performance.


\subsection{Migration Issues}

%% more to say about the style of migration in SP?

Enabling sound types on a function has a ripple effect on callers.
All untyped callers are now forced to supply type-correct inputs; may call for
refactoring.

Enabling checked types has a huge ripple effect.
The worst case is changing an annotation to a expect a checked data structure:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item all callers must create a checked value by invoking the right constructor, and
  \item all clients of those callers can no longer expect an unchecked type.
\end{enumerate}
Programmers have to trace the annotation back to value-creation points, and then
ensure that all uses of those values are compatible.


\section{Model}
\label{s:model}
%% purpose = types, checks, and optimizations can be formalized and analyzed


\subsection{Surface Language}


\subsection{Evaluation Language, Optimizations}


\subsection{Bug Reports}

While formalizing Static Python, we submitted N bug reports to the language developers.
The developers acknowledged M of these bugs as issues to fix.


\section{Under the Hood: Static Python Specifics}
\label{s:impl}

Purpose: explain significant gaps between the model and the implementation.
E.g. what would the TypeScript team need to know before using our model
to add soundness?


\section{Evaluation}
\label{s:eval}


\subsection{Benchmarks}


\subsection{Production Experience}


\section{Related Work}

Nom~\cite{mt-oopsla-2017} is foundational.
Thorn~\cite{wnlov-popl-2010} and StrongScript~\cite{rzv-ecoop-2015} are related.

PyPy is another runtime for Python
Pycket is built on PyPy and improves both Typed Racket~\cite{bbst-oopsla-2017}
and Reticulated Python~\cite{vsc-dls-2019}.


\section{Future Work}

Adapt SP ideas to a new setting, test performance takeaways.

Improve SP with generic types, structural types (lambda), \ldots.

Build an automatic migration tool for Checked data.

Build a static analysis that hoists transient annotations to an early, shared point.
Take care to give quality error messages.


\section{Conclusion}
\label{s:conclusion}

Sound types in Static Python give programmers a way to improve performance.
The change is not forced, not intrusive;
programmers can keep using unsound types when working toward a deadline.

Conjecture that soundness will find bugs too, and lead to more reliable products.
Too soon to say.
