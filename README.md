# insta-model

The goal of this project is to model Static Python, a gradually typed variant
of Python developed at Instagram. To show that this project models Static
Python faithfully, we borrow hundreds of conformance tests from [Static
Python's test
suite](https://github.com/facebookincubator/cinder/blob/cinder/3.8/Lib/test/test_compiler/test_static/tests.py).
This repository includes a copy of the test suite (`tests.py`) fetched on
2022-01-09 (commit hash: `6d61575`).

## Prerequisites

- [Racket 8.3](https://download.racket-lang.org/racket-v8.3.html) (or newer).
  * Install Racket from the link above.
  * Make sure that the `racket` and `raco` executables are on your path.
- [Python 3.9](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-390/)
  * Make sure that a `python3.9` executable is on your path.
  * Newer versions of Python may work, but you'll need to change the `Makefile`
    to use the correct executable.

### Alternative: Docker

The `Dockerfile` declares an image with Racket and Python.
To use it, start the docker daemon (maybe with `sudo dockerd`) and run the following commands:

```
docker build -t insta-model .
docker run -v "$PWD:/vol" -w /vol -ti insta-model bash
```


## How to run

Run `make`. That's all!

The `Makefile` builds and executes a comprehensive test suite for the model.
The main steps are:

 1. Import test cases from Static Python's test suite.
 2. Print statistics about the imported tests.
 3. Convert test cases to Redex syntax.
 4. Test the model's syntax, type checker, runtime, and correctness theorems.

## How to validate claims from the paper?

This section lists claims that we made in the paper, and where in this repository to find the corresponding evidences.

> (page 10; Section 4) The model covers a substantial part of the Python language including assertions, loops, exception handlers, and delete statements.

You might use `grep` to validate that we test those language constructs in [./conformance_suite](./conformance_suite). For example, to see whether we tested assertions, you can run

```bash
$ grep 'assert ' -r ./conformance_suite/
```

> (page 10; Section 4) Second, we used Redex’s random testing tools to check type soundness on thousands of examples (1,600 expressions and 11,000 programs).

We have two uses of [`redex-check`](https://docs.racket-lang.org/redex/reference.html#%28form._%28%28lib._redex%2Freduction-semantics..rkt%29._redex-check%29%29) in [./conjectures.rkt](./conjectures.rkt). (TODO: numbers in code are different from numbers in paper. What is the right thing to do?)

> (page 10; Section 4) we translated 265 tests from the Static Python regression suite to the syntax of the model and confirmed that the results do match, which suggests that the model conforms to actual Static Python.

You can see the number (265) if you run 

```bash
make statistics
```

> (page 10; Section 4) For most of the 265 tests, the translation is automatic. A few tests required hand- pruning to remove features that the model does not handle (52 total)

You can see the number (52) with 

```bash
ls ./conformance_suite/edited_test_* | wc -l
```

> (page 10; Section 4) Static Python has 537 other tests (802 total) that we did not use because they fall outside the scope of the model.

`make statistics` also produces this number (802).

> (page 13; Section 4.2.1) Most [casts] call for a tag check, i.e., a Python isinstance test. The sole exception is optional types, which require a tag check and a test for the none value.

If you look at [the definition of `compile-check` in `./compile.rkt`](https://github.com/brownplt/insta-model/blob/c9f21f5479b2dd4f9ddbfabacba88d22b3cb1811/compile.rkt#L1225), the `dynamic` case is trivial. The function case is unreachable because there is no function type in the surface syntax. We use function types internally to make checking function/method calls easier. The remaining two cases are more interesting. When the target type is a class, `compile-check` calls [`check-exactness`](https://github.com/brownplt/insta-model/blob/c9f21f5479b2dd4f9ddbfabacba88d22b3cb1811/compile.rkt#L1244), which effectively performs a tag-check. The remaining case is for `Optional[T]`, which has a test for the none value and a recursive call. Because the `T` in `Optional[T]` must be a class, the check must be a tag check.

> (page 13; Section 4.2.1) No cast requires traversing a data structure. Similarly, no cast allocates a wrapper to check higher-order behaviors in a delayed fashion.

`compile-check` calls [`check-exactness`](https://github.com/brownplt/insta-model/blob/c9f21f5479b2dd4f9ddbfabacba88d22b3cb1811/compile.rkt#L1244), which uses `is` or `issubclass` to compare the object's tag and the expected tag. The object fields are never traversed.

## Conformance Tests

Each file under `conformance_suite` is a test case written as a commented Python file. They come from two sources.

Files named as `test_*` are extracted from `tests.py` with a script `scripts/import_SP_tests.py`. Files named as `edited_test_*` are edited after extraction. Some tests in `tests.py` are not extracted for various reasons. You can find in `left-out_reason.csv` reasons why each of them was left-out. For each left-out reason, you can find the corresponding string patterns at the beginning of `scripts/import_SP_tests.py`.

All other tests are written by us. `Statics.md` and `Dynamics.md` lists those tests together with their purposes.

## The Model

The script `scripts/python_tests_to_redex_tests.py` parses files in
`conformance_suite` and translate them to model tests. We have four test files:

- `test-grammar.rkt`
- `test-desugar.rkt`
- `test-compile.rkt`
- `test-runtime.rkt`

Each of the first three files contains all (ASTs of) Static Python programs in
`conformance_suite`. Some programs also occur in `test-runtime.rkt`.

The file `grammar.rkt` defines the grammar of the AST of the modeled subset of
Static Python.

The file `desugar.rkt` removes some syntactic sugars and performs some other
syntatic transformations that don't involve types. This file also defines the
output language, `SP-core`.

The file `compile.rkt` models the Static Python compiler and type-checker. The
most interesting definitions are `compile-e`, which compiles an expression, and
`compile-s`, which compiles an statement. Ill-typed programs should fail the
compilation.

The file `runtime.rkt` models the runtime semantics. The most interesting
definitions are `load` and `red-p`. The function `load` creates an execution
state out of a program. `red-p` is the reduction relation of execution states.

The file `conjectures.rkt` tests the model with randomly generated programs.

The file `utilities.rkt` provides helper definitions to all these model files.

## Other files

`Makefile` makes it convenient to run the model and to show the statistics of
test counts. If you want to dig deeper into this code base, it might be a good
idea to start from the `Makefile`.

`pj-7.1` directory contains the source code of our paper.

`run_conformance_suite.sh` is a script that can run conformance tests **using**
Static Python. This script has three major prerequisites:

 1. Static Python is installed. Follow the instructions in its
    [README](https://github.com/facebookincubator/cinder) to get started.
 2. The script must be copied to a directory `SP/<dir>/`, where `SP` is the
    name of the difertory where Static Python is installed and `<dir>` is the
    (arbitrary) name of a new subdirectory.
 3. There is a copy of `conformance_suite` inside `SP/<dir>/`
